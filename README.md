# AwsSA
## IAM (global)
- IAM user:- user to access 
- IAM group:- set of users
- IAM policies:- set of permissions to aws services in json format
version,statement(effect,action,resource,principal)
- IAM password policy 
- MFA multifactor authentication for enhanced security for your login
- google authenticator virtual,U2F security key physical
- UI (Managment console,CLI,SDK)
- login to Management console protected by password + MFA(optional)
- login to CLI protected by access key ID,secret access key
- login to SDK protected by access key ID,secret access key
- Cloudshell is an alternative terminal to execute cli commands (regions limited)
- Best practice to get permissions is via IAM role
- IAM Security Tools 
- IAM credential report (account) audit user credentials status in account
- IAM Access Advisor report (user level) audit services accessed by user

## EC2
- OS,Instace Size & config,Storage,Security Group,Bootstrap
- Bootstrap code runs as root user
- instance naming convention instanceclass:generation:size
- https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
- General,Compute Optimized,Memory Optimized
- https://instances.vantage.sh/

##### Security Group
- region specific
- they act as firewall to Ec2 instances
- If application gets timed out,security group issue
- Connection refused its an application issue
- All inbound traffic are blocked by default
- All outbound traffic are allowed

##### EC2 access
- SSH to the box
- EC2 instance connect only amazon linux 2
- Elastic IP is static public IP.It s limited to 5 per account
- Not a great practice to use elastic IP.use DNS instead
- SSH uses public IP for EC2 instance connect
- Placement group (cluster,spread,partition)
- Big Data Job uses cluster placement group 
- Spread placement group 7 per AZ
- Hadoop,Cassandra,Kafka uses partition
- ENI provides Private IP Address,Elastic IP Address,MAC Address.It can be attached or detached to Ec2.used in fail over scenarios
- EC2 hibernate Usecases like long running processes,preserve EBS volume 
- EC2 hibernate no more than 60 days.It should have root EBS volume
- EBS volume is a network drive.Its locked to AZ.To move volume across AZ snapshot should be taken
- root EBS volume deleted on termination by default other EBS volumes are not
- EBS Snapshot Archive moves snapshot to archive tier
- Recycle bin helps setting up rules to restore deleted snapshots from 1 day to 1 year
- Fastest Snapshot Restore no latency
- AMI amazon machine image can be public,custom and market place
- EC2 instance store provides high performance but they are temporary i3 series 100124 random read IOPS and 35000 write IOPS

## LoadBalancing
- Servers that forward traffic to multiple EC2 instance
- Classic Load Balancer (v1 old generation) support HTTP,HTTPS,TCP,SSL(Secure TCP)
- Application Load Balancer (v2 new generation) support HTTP,HTTPS,Websocket
- Network Load Balancer (v2 new generation) support TCP,TLS,UDP
- Gateway LoadBalancer Network layer IP Protocol
### Application Load Balancer
- It s layery7 loadbalancer supporting HTTP & HTTPS
- Routing based on URL,hostname and query string
- great fit for microservices (container based ECS because of port mapping)
- Target groups are EC2 instances with ASG,ECS tasks,lambda functions
- Client's details can be obtained from headers like x-forwarded-for,x-forwarded-port,x-forwarded-proto
### Network Load Balancer
- Layer 4 load balancer
- TCP,UDP traffic to your instances
- handle millions of request with low latency
- supports static IP
### Gateway Load Balancer
- Deploy,scale 3rd party network virtual appliances
- example firewall,intrusion detection and prevention system,deep packet inspection systems,payload manipulation
- tansparent network gateway and load balancer
- uses GENEV protocol on port 6081
## Elastic Load Balancer
- Sticky sessions are implemented using cookies.
- cookies  are of 2 types they are application based and duration based
- custom cookies are generated by cookie they cannot use reserved names like AWSALB,AWSALBAPP,AWSALBTG
- application cookies are generated by loadbalancer with name AWSALBAPP
- duration based cookies are generated by load balancer AWSALB for ALB,AWSELB for CLB
- Cross Zone Load Balancing is enabled by default for Application Load Balancer
- Cross Zone Load Balancing is disable by default for Network Load Balancer and charges are payable
- Cross Zone Load Balancing is disable by default for Classic Load Balancer and charges are not payable
- Server Name Indication loading multiple SSL certificates onto one web server works with Application and network load balancer
- Connection draining for CLB and deregistering delay for ALB,NLB
- default 300s between 1 to 3600s

## AutoScaling Group
- Scale out,Scale in,automatic registering and dregistering from loadbalancer
- Launch template containing AMI + instance type,EC2 user data,EBS vloumes,security group,ssh key pair,IAM roles,network subnet info and load balancer
- Target tracking,simple step up scaling policy,scheduled actions,Predictive scaling
- CPU utilization,RequestCountPerTarget,Average network in/out,any custom metric
- default cool down period is 300s,ASG will not launch or terminate additional instances

## Instantiating the applications quickly
- Use Golden AMI for Ec2 instances and user data scripts for dynamic configurations
- Use both golden AMI and bootstrap data for elastic bean stalk
- Restore snapshot for RDS instances
- Restore snapshot for EBS

## Elastic Bean Stalk
- Components are configuration,version,environments
- create app->upload version->launch enviornment
- Supported platforms are Go,Java,.Net,Node js,PHP,Python,Ruby,Packet builder,Single,Multi docker,Preconfigured
- Webserver tier includes ALB,ASG
- Worker tier ALB,ASG,SQS

## Messaging
- SQS queue model,SNS Pub Sub,Kinesis real time streaming model
- SQS aws oldest offering used to decouple applications
- retention of messages 4 to 14 days.message size 256 Kb.low latency < 10 ms
- can have duplicate messages and out of order messages.unlimted throughput
- consumers can run on ec2 instances,lambda
- consumers once done with processing the message and delete them.consumers can be integrated with ASG based on queue length cloud watch metric
- inflight encryption using HTTPS and at REST encryption using KMS keys
- Access policy for SQS s there similar to S3
- dead-letter queue (DLQ) is a special type of message queue that temporarily stores messages that a software system cannot process due to errors
- message visibility timeout makes the message invisible for the consumers to recieve.visbility timeout too low leads to duplicates.visibility timeout too high its difficult to reprocess
- Long polling s where consumer waits even when there are no messages in the queue.can be enabled at queue level or API level using waittimeseconds
- FIFO queue limited throughput 300 msg/s without batching 3000 msgs with batching.exactly once send capbility.ordering of msgs maintained
- SNS one message multiple recievers.SNS FIFO topic only SQS subscription wheres standard topic supports other subscription protocols like SQS,lambda,mobile app,HTTP,SMS,EMail
- Topic publish API create a topic,subscription and publish to the topic.direct publish for mobile apps
- SNS securtiy inflight encryption using HTTPS api and at rest encryption using KMS keys
- SNS + muliple SQS queues,SNS + Kinesis Data Firehouse, .subscription based on Message filtering 
- Apps using RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ can be migrated to AWS using Amazon MQ.traditional protocols like AMQP.not scalable like SQS or SNS 
- Kinesis data streams uses shard based.messages having same partition key goes to same shard
- retention is 1 to 365 days.message once inserted cannot be deleted
- for producers we can use sdk,kinesis producer library and kinesis agent
- for consumers we can use sdk,kinesis client library and kinesis agent
- provisioned mode and on demand mode
- kinesis data for house can streams data to S2,redshift,opensearch.fully managed.near realtime
- for ordering partition key in kinesis and group id in FIFO
- 20 trucks per shard.max amount of consumers in parallel is 5
- FIFO queue uses max 100 group id

## ECS,EKS and Fargate
- Docker is a platform using which we can deploy apps
- Building docker creates docker image which can be stored in public repo called docker hub or private hub called elastic container registry(ECR has public gallery)
- VMs run on hypervisor whereas dockers run on docker daemon.containers share networking
- ECS data vloumes is EFS
- While creating ECS cluster 3 options like fargate,EC2 instances,external instances using ECS anywhere
- ECS service to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition simultaneously in an Amazon ECS cluster
- For automatic scaling we can use ECS service average CPU utilization,ECS service memory utilization,ALB request count per target
- architectures example ECS with eventbridge & SQS
- EKS supports 2 launch modes Fargate and EC2.kubernetes is cloud agnostic
- EKS Pods in worker nodes.
- Managed node groups & self managed node groups(prebuild AMI)
- AWS AppRunner fully managed service to deploy web apps

## RDS (Relational database service)
- Managed service with automated provisioning,OS patching,continous backup,read replica,multi AZ setup,scaling and EBS storage.we cannot SSH
- RDS engines are mariadb,mysql,oracle,postgres,SQL server
- Read replicas are limited to 5.within AZ,cross AZ or region
- Replcation is async
- Replcas can be promoted to main
- Applications update connection string for read replicas
- Use cases are where read workload should not affect the regular workload
- Same region replication traffic is free whereas cross region is payable
- RDS multi AZ provides Disaster Recovery
- one DNS name automatic app failover to standby
- read replicas be setup as multi AZ for diasaster recovery
- 0 downtime from single to multi AZ.Internally snapshot is taken,new DB is restored from snapshot in new AZ and finally sync between the dbs
- Database authentication are of 3 types.they are password authentication,IAM database authentication and Kerberos authentication
- RDS custom for Microsoft SQL server and oracle access to underlying OS,can do SSH access
### Amazon Aurora 
- proprietary technology and compatible drivers 
- aws cloud optimized 5X performance improvement over MySQL 3x performance improvement over postgres
- It s 20% cost more and has features High availability,15 replicas
- 

### Elasticache
- Managed redis or memcached
- in memory databases with low latency and high performance
- reduce load off of databases of read intensive workloads
- helps make your application stateless
- using elasticache needs heavy application code changes
- Acts as db cache code changes for cache hit,cache write and invalidation 
- Acts as user session store
- Rediscache has multi AZ,read replicas have high availability,back and restore just like RDS underlying concept set and sorted set
- MemCached has multi node for partitioning of data,No high availability,non persistent,No backup and restore, underlying concept is sharding
- IAM authentication for Redis only.Redis auth includes password token and inflight SSL encryption 
- Memcached uses SASL
- Lazy loading,Write through and session store(TTL)
- Redis sorted sets provides both uniqueness and ordering.usecase is gaming leaderboard
-
## S3
- Storage,archive,Application hosting,media hosting,diaster recovery,data lakes,analytics
- S3 stores files in buckets.Files are called objects
- Bucket name should be globally unique name.It should not have uppercase,underscore.It is 3 - 63 characters long.not an ip.must not start with prefix xn.must not send with suffix s3alias.
- Objects have key.The key is entire path.no concepts of directories within buckets 
- Max file size 5TB .Files greater than 5 GB should use multipart upload
- User based policy IAM
- Resource based policy - bucket policy,object access control,bucket access control
- Bucket policy are json based and has the same syntax as IAM policy
- Bucket settings are enabled for preventing data leaks
- we can host static website using S3.enabling static website host will ask you to create index.html and all the bucket contents as public
- versioning of the files is at bucket level.Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling version will be have version as null
- Delete just adds delete marker only when permanently delete the object gets deleted
- Replication are of 2 types cross region replication and same region replication.Versioning has to be enabled as copying s done async
- After replication,only new objects gets replicated,for existing it s S3 batch replication
- replication can replicate only delete marker not permanently delete
- S3 standard used for frequent access 
- S3 standard IA is for infrequent access cost less than standard.use case Diaster Recover and backup.minimum storage 30 days
- S3 one zone IA infrequent storing secondary backup.minimum storage 30 days
- S3 Glacier low cost storage for archiving 
- S3 Glacier instant retrieval is for ms retrievalminimum storage 90 days
- S3 Glacier Flexible retrieval expedited ( 1 to 5 mins),standard(3 to 5 hrs),bulk(5 to 12hrs).minimum storage 90 days
- S3 Glacier Deep archive for long term storage.standard(12 hrs) bulk (48 hrs).minimum storage 180 days
- S3 intelligent tiering moves objects based on usage
- S3 lifecycle are rules that helps to move objects between storage classes based on configured conditions
- Transition actions are rules for moving and expiration actions are rules for deletion.u can give both current and non current versions
- S3 analytics for analysing the storage class usage with suggestions
- S3 requester pays networking cost.requester must be IAM user so that billed accordingly
- S3 event notifications need IAM persmissions
- S3 event notifications with event bridge helps to send notifications to many
- S3 transfer accleration uses edge locations to speed up transfer upload.compatible with multipart
- S3 byte range fetches can be used to increase downloads.can be used in retrieving partial data
- S3 select and Glacier select retrieves less data using SQL 
- S3 batch operations have numerous usecases like encyrpt unencrypted objects
- S3 inventory to get object listand use S3 to filter
- S3 encryption has 4 types namely SSE-S3,SSE-KMS,SSE-C and client side encryption
- SSE-S3 header set for AES-256
- SSE-KMS keys manged by KMS limitation due to KMS quota
- SSE-C key provided by the customer.It will never be stored in AWS.https is used
- encryption at flight is done by HTTPS endpoint.can be forced by securetransport of bucket policy
- Default encryption is SSE-S3.It can be set via bucket policies using explicit deny when the key string not equals.Pleas note bucket policies are evaluated before default encyrption
